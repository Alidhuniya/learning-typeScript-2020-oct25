/*
   TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases.
   For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
*/
let helloWorld = "Hello World"; // if you hover on "helloworld" variable typeScript will suggest string type
